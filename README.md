Repository structure: the main folder contains the calibration files as well as the draft of the 2021 report.

LaH_200gpa_XRD_from_uspex - uspex search

Raman - raman spectra of DACs

Refinement_pictures - XRD "cakes"

Refinement_files 1,2,3 - refinement files from Jana2006, where we have roughly refined the unit cell parameters of compounds to construct the equation of state and determine the approximate hydrogen content of the hydrides obtained.
